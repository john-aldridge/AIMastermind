# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editing tool. The icons should:
- Be PNG format with transparent backgrounds
- Follow Chrome extension design guidelines
- Be visually consistent across all sizes
- Represent the AI Mastermind brand

## Quick Icon Generation

You can use online tools or design software to create icons:
- Figma
- Canva
- Adobe Illustrator
- Photopea (free online tool)

Or use a placeholder generator during development:
- https://via.placeholder.com/16
- https://via.placeholder.com/32
- https://via.placeholder.com/48
- https://via.placeholder.com/128

## Current Status

⚠️ **TODO**: Icons need to be created and added to this directory.

For development purposes, you can use placeholder images or the extension will use Chrome's default icon.
